    <H3>WHAT IS DATASCIENCE?</H2>
        <P>Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses data to create insights that help businesses make
            decisions. It combines math, statistics, computer engineering, and artificial intelligence (AI).
        </P>
        <H3>A data science project undergoes the following stages:</H3>
        <P>Data ingestion: The lifecycle begins with the data collection—both raw structured and unstructured data from
            all relevant sources using a variety of methods. These methods can include manual entry, web scraping, and
            real-time streaming data from systems and devices. Data sources can include structured data, such as
            customer data, along with unstructured data like log files, video, audio, pictures, the Internet of Things
            (IoT), social media, and more.</P>
        <P>Data storage and data processing: Since data can have different formats and structures, companies need to
            consider different storage systems based on the type of data that needs to be captured. Data management
            teams help to set standards around data storage and structure, which facilitate workflows around analytics,
            machine learning and deep learning models. This stage includes cleaning data, deduplicating, transforming
            and combining the data using ETL (extract, transform, load) jobs or other data integration technologies.
            This data preparation is essential for promoting data quality before loading into a data warehouse, data
            lake, or other repository.
        </P>
        <P>Data analysis: Here, data scientists conduct an exploratory data analysis to examine biases, patterns,
            ranges, and distributions of values within the data. This data analytics exploration drives hypothesis
            generation for a/b testing. It also allows analysts to determine the data’s relevance for use within
            modeling efforts for predictive analytics, machine learning, and/or deep learning. Depending on a model’s
            accuracy, organizations can become reliant on these insights for business decision making, allowing them to
            drive more scalability.
        </P>
        <P>Communicate: Finally, insights are presented as reports and other data visualizations that make the
            insights—and their impact on business—easier for business analysts and other decision-makers to understand.
            A data science programming language such as R or Python includes components for generating visualizations;
            alternately, data scientists can use dedicated visualization tools.
        </P>
